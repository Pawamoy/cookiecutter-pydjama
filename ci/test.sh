# Using tox through tox with long env names results in too long shebang issue in pip script.
# See https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/66.
# A workaround here is to use a truncation of a hash of the env name to reduce the size of the
# path and hence the size of the shebang in pip script.
# With the current env names, truncate to 4 characters results in 1 collision.
# Truncate to 6 should be enough for future changes.

# The thing is, not everybody can or wants to use /tmp, and sometimes this very code will be
# nested in a very long path, so this trick won't work. The fix should come from tox or
# virtualenv/pip (the one who creates the pip script) themselves.
